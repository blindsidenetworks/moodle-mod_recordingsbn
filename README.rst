RecordingsBN Activity Module for Moodle 2.x
===========================================
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system that enables universities and colleges to deliver a high-quality learning experience to remote students.  

These instructions describe how to install the RecordingsBN Activity Module for Moodle 2.x.  This module is developed and supported by Blindside Networks, the company that started the BigBlueButton project in 2007.

With this plugin you can
	- Create resource links to recordings made with BigBlueButton (requires bigbluebuttonbn plugin to be installed)
	- Publish/unpublish and delete recordings

Prerequisites
=============
You need:

        1.  A server running Moodle 2.0+
        2.  A BigBlueButton 0.8-beta-4 (or later) server running on a separate server (not on the same server as your Moodle site)

Blindside Networks provides you a test BigBlueButton server for testing this plugin.  To use this test server, just accept the default settings when configuring the activity module.  The default settings are

	url: http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/

	salt: 8cd8ef52e8e101574e400365b55e11a6
